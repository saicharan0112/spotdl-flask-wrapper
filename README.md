# WebUI wrapper for Spotdl using Flask

made a webUI to download songs via spotdl. Used Flask in the backend and a simple html/css for the front-end.

The UI takes the spotify song/playlist/album URL along with the download path, and downloads it for you in the given path.

(an excuse to try the Flask library for the first time)
